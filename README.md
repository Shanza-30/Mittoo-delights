Mittoo's Delights is a beautifully designed and fully responsive ice cream shop website that brings the charm of a real-life dessert parlor to the digital world. This front-end project is crafted using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Font Awesome, offering a delightful and modern user experience for visitors of all screen sizes.

The website is tailored for a fictional brand, Mittoo's Delights, known for its handcrafted, premium-quality ice creams. The interface features a vibrant color scheme, smooth layout, and interactive design elements that reflect the playful and inviting nature of the brand. Key sections include a visually engaging hero banner, a flavor showcase with high-quality images, a heartfelt About Us section, real customer testimonials, and essential contact information, all organized in a clean and scroll-friendly layout.

This project demonstrates effective use of utility-first CSS through Tailwind for quick development and responsiveness, while also incorporating icons via Font Awesome to enrich the UI. It serves as a perfect showcase of front-end development skills and is ideal for portfolio presentation or learning modern web design practices.
